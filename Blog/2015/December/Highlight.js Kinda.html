The Highlight.js is kinda not working with Swift. I am not sure if it has swift in it's library, and I am not sure why the code is adding a bunch of tabs for the first line of every piece of code. I can't fix it at the moment. Maybe I should email the tech support at OSU, but they are probably on break for Christmas now (I would hope that they are on break now).
