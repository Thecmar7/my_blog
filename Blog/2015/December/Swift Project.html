So I have been thinking about what project I want to create with the Swift programming language and I want to make a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation">Reverse Polish Notation Calculator</a>. I think this is an awesome project pretty weird and cool, so I think that is what I will tackle, but I am realizing I forgot some important things that I should have mentioned before we start this project. I need to go over arrays, and optional variables. I can't believe I forgot arrays, but optionals are something that I have never seen before. I think I will go over those tomorrow though.

I saw the new Star Wars. I thought it was good, but I am not that big of a nerd fan. I just think that it is fun.
