Well I added a bunch of stuff to my <a href="https://github.com/Thecmar7">GitHub</a>, and while I was there I was looking around the popular open source things and found the Swift computer language. Oh man I wish I could figure out this huge project and piece it together. There is no starter guide for the the source code of the Swift language. I guess I will look into it. I should probably learn how to code in Swift too. I will work on that.
