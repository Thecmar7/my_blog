I love the subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/">/r/dailyprogrammer</a> and I want to practice programming in some languages that I know but don't have an opportunity to use very often. So I did the last easy problem in Python. I was not feeling the harder ones it is way too late. I don't know why I am up doing this.

// code
python

"""
In number theory, a deficient or deficient number is a number n for which the sum of divisors sigma(n)<2n, or, equivalently, the sum of proper divisors (or aliquot sum) s(n)<n. The value 2n - sigma(n) (or n - s(n)) is called the number's deficiency. In contrast, an abundant number or excessive number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number itself
As an example, consider the number 21. Its divisors are 1, 3, 7 and 21, and their sum is 32. Because 32 is less than 2 x 21, the number 21 is deficient. Its deficiency is 2 x 21 - 32 = 10.

The integer 12 is the first abundant number. Its divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12, and their sum is 28. Because 28 is greater than 2 x 12, the number 12 is abundant. It's abundant by is 28 - 24 = 4. (Thanks /u/Rev0lt_ for the correction.)
"""

# every good program deserves a main.
def main():
	# gets the three numbers 
	numbers = []
	inputv = True
	while(inputv):
		num = input()
		if (num == 0):
			inputv = False
		else:
			numbers.append(num)

	
	for num in numbers:
		# gets the facotors 	
		factors = []		
		for i in range(1, num + 1):
			for j in range(i, num + 1):
				if (i * j == num):
					factors.append(i)
					factors.append(j)
		
		#sums them up
		total = 0;
		print factors
		for i in factors:
			total = total + i;

		# prints out if the number is deficiant or abundant
		if (num * 2 > total):
			print str(num) + " deficient"
		else:
			print str(num) + " abundant by " + str(total - (num * 2));

main()

// code end

I did not really understand the prompt. I am not sure how to distinguish the abundant and deficient, but this works for their sample output. I am not sure how to know if the number is neither either. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/3uuhdk/20151130_challenge_243_easy_abundant_and/">Here</a> is the actual problem. I want to do these kind of things more often especially when I have some down time. But it's three in the morning. This should be my laying down time! hahahahahahahahah oh goodness my head hurts.
