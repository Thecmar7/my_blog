Okay wow. I am trying to do more daily programmer problems. So today I took on one that would have been pretty easy but I wanted to make it a little more interesting and use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)">Ruby</a>.  And I had heard some things about Ruby and I most of it was really good. Maybe I jumped into it too fast or something cause I am not seeing the greatness, but I guess I used to hate PHP too... Besides the point. Ruby is great, but honestly I was overwhelmed by the options.

So in this Daily programmer problem (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/3pcb3i/20151019_challenge_237_easy_broken_keyboard/">#237</a>) I had to use user input and output and some file I/O and a bunch of loops. So I looked up how to get user input. It was easy enough. You want to <strong> get </strong> user input so you use get. That will return a string from standard input. The I wanted to output some information. There are <strong>3</strong> methods that are commonly used to output to stdout: put, print and even printf. These all work. I don't know which one is best or most common to use, but these are the three I know of. I used print. But then I looked into arrays and loops and there is no normal for loop. There is a while and a for each of sorts, but the for loop is a for each. 

I don't know. I guess I making stupid complaints. I need to learn more about Ruby before I can really say that I don't like it but for now I find that I can't figure out what the convention is. There are too many options for me to say that this the way that I should output or loop through my array. I feel that when I am using C this is one way to output stdout, and that way works, and everyone has to use it. I guess I didn't realize how much I like those rules that make a language look more uniform. Or maybe I am not to a high enough level of coding to see that every language is not as restrictive as I am prone to thinking. Or maybe Ruby is just such a High Level language that it is crazy and dumb. Maybe I should just stick to the languages that I "know" for now. I say "know" cause I really don't think I will every completely know any language. I have a lot to learn.
