// post

This <strong>is</strong> going to be my first blog post and I am going to use it mostly for testing! :D I just wanna see what will happpen if I make this line really long! What do you think will happen! I think it will wrap around the page and it should look fine. But I am wondering how I will want to make this work when I am actually using to make blog posts this would want to be in seperate paragraph tags right now I have the whole post is a paragraph tag.. I am not sure if that is the best course of action.

I am going to use PHP to get do the File I/O and then send it to the main page using ajax THis should be fun! :D

Lets see this is a couple days later and after a bit of work I have got it the way I want it to be :) 

// code

	<h1> yay </h1>
	//This is code! 
	for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
		System.out.println("poop");
	}
	
// code end

I am going to format the code sections by adding the tag "// code" and "// code end" this is like having tags in like in HTML but they are mine... I have heard this is how people used to do like XHTML or XML or something really bad... Like this is a terrible system I am setting up but I understand it and I am going to get it to work.

I am disappointed with the Code that the tab doesn't work... I wonder if there is a tab special character I can look at in the gotten text that would allow me to know to add a tab myself in the Code sections...?
