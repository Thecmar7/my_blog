This is the second post! I have the blog almost up and running. I need to test that the blog will get the blog post that are the most recent post and then print them out in the right order. So right now they are getting printed in the right order but I think that is conincidental. 

Oh wait they aren't in the right order... I want this one to be first.

ksort is an amazing function in PHP. I could not think of a way to sort the array of dates and file paths to so that the posts would show up in chonological order, but all I had to so was use ksort and that fixed the whole problem!

I will be posting this code on GitHub once I am happy with the amount of progress that I have made.
