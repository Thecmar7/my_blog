3D printing
Life

// post

I put it together. It's not alive but it is together.

<strong>(a couple days later)</strong> : sorry for the super short post. It's more like a tweet then a post. I was trying to see how well I could access and post to my blog from my iPad using a server app and it was less than successful. I could create a document and stuff but has a lot of formatting errors. 

Anyway I was talking about my 3D printer. You should see it now. It is so pretty and beautiful. All I have to do is the wiring and it will be ready to run... I think. I am a complete 3D printer noob. I don't know what I am doing, but I plan to learn a lot. It was a blast to put together I hope it is a long and fun project that I can share with you guys for a long time.
