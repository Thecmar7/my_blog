This has been a long week. I feel like I am super busy, but I also feel like I am missing or forgetting something and that I have not done enough work. My classes aren't hard. I have been able to get everything done on the weekends. I think I sit around doing nothing a lot, but I also feel like there is not enough hours in the day. I have got my 3D printer working and sucking up a couple hours every day. It wasn't very smart to get it and put in right next to my work desk. "Hey Cramer, you know those things in the Valley Library that you love to just stare at while they print 3D objects? Yeah those things? YOu should get one and put it in your room so you can have something to stare at while you are at home. That's a great idea." Honestly though I love my 3D printer I feel like it is almost fully callibrated and I have figured out how to raise the bed and I have printed some pretty neat things. I would show you some pictures but I am feeling lazy and don't wanna. 

Besides my printer being up and running and eating away my time I have been much more active with CRU. We had a second game night at our house and packed the place. We need a bigger house or better games. It is getting somewhat lame playing the youth group mixer games over and over and over. 

I want to get back into improving the blog again. But I like how well it is working right now I am afraid to have a problem that sets it back. But at the same time I feel that the blog is lacking a lot of functionality that any blog can't be without. 

<ol><li>Comments</li><li>Ordered viewing of pages</li><li>sorting posts by category</li><li>better post creation than vim</li><li>compression of posts (sidebar and maybe the data)</li><li>It's own domain</li></ol>

Then don't even get me started with the actual website.
