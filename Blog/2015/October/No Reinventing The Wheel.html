		I have been working on this blog for a while and my hope is that soon I will be able to post code on it and really make it into a place where I can post about the projects I am working on and kinda think out load with in-depth research into each topic. So for that to happen I want to make is very easy and nice for when I input code. I was thinking of implementing my own code highlighter then the more I thought about it the less I wanted to try and figure that out. But I have the tendency to do that. I see a project and think that I could recreate this big idea all on my own. Though through this year I have been learning that a lot of other people do web programming and that a lot of other people have created these big ideas already. So I found a syntax highlighter online called <a href="https://highlightjs.org">highlight.js</a> I have never really used a "framework" before. I am not sure if it is a framework but I just had to put the script in the header and call the function and it make the code look nice.
// code

<html>
<head>
	<title>foo</title>
</head>

<body>
	<p>bar</p>
</body

// code end
I am not just realizing that textures don't allow tabs. Dang.
