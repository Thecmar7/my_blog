	Well now I have a nice form that allows me to make blog posts without using a text editor so that is great! I am happy that I go this done today I honestly thought that this would be a lot harder than it was, but it was fairly easy. I feel like that for most of the programming projects I take on the hard part is getting started. I fell good about the form but the bad part is that the thing takes in a "password" and I am sure that any novice computer nerd could find out how to "hack" and post anything they want on my blog. That is a little scary, but I feel like not a lot of people are looking at this blog and thinking "Man I wish I could hack that thing." No no one reads this except maybe Kenzi.
