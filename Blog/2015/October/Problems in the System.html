Ok it has been a long weekend. I went from Bellingham and back again, and now I am trying to get back into the groove of doing homework and making mistakes. 

Well I have some issues with this system. Making a blog post entails that I (the user) has to specifically format the document that I want to post. I feel that as a user I would hate this system in real life, and I am frustrated and ashamed that I have made it this way and have thought it acceptable. I have to constantly update and add my the files the correct data in the correct order and format. So how could I make this so I could type the information and it would be formatted for me. Well I have 2 ideas:

<ol><li>I could make the a website and a Form that I would input into and then it would create the formatting istelf. </li><li>I could create a Bash script that would take in input and then put it in a correctly formatted file. </li></ol>

Now I see issues with both of these optioins and I really don't like either of them. With 1 I have a potential security issue, and with two I don't know bash and I can see it being even less user friendly then just formatting the documents myself.

I think I will do the web form. That is more in my field and I can work on some security measures as well. We'll see how that goes.
