	Well I feel foolish I could have used a simple system that is already in place and had a guaranteed internship, but sadly I was not very proactive. So instead of taking this "free pass" I didn't think I had the time to do it. So now I am having to look for internship the old fashioned way, and it is lame. I have never had an internship before. I really want one. Actually I really need one. I need some type of experience, before I get into the real world. So now I have to apply like crazy to a bunch of random companies and it felt like none of them are going to actually look at me. Oh well I am not going to give up. I will apply to two places every week until I get someone that is interested. 
Until then I will be working on my website classes and just life in general. I hope everything works out for the best.
