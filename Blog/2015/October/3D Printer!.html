IT'S COMMING TODAY!

I am so excited! I keep checking my phone for the UPS tracking updates. Sad thing is when it gets here I will have to go to Bellingham for the weekend. So I can't put it together! It's so sad it will just have to sit here all weekend and do nothing.

I will Post about it more when I get it and start setting it up next week.

I came n at abiut seven today. As I was stepping out the door to leave for the road. I am too excited to sleep. even though I cant play with it anytime soon. I am worried though. You see I had enough time to open the box and peek inside at everything, and no instructions in sight! I dont know how to put something like this together! its gonna be quite the endevour.
