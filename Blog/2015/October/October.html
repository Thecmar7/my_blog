I don't really like october. I think Halloween is a lame holiday, and going back into winter is kinda sad. I like fall though I think it's pretty, but it's a very beautiful goodbye to the nice weather and being able to walk outside in the evening and the warm afternoons and the puddless sidewalks. I miss that. I like the sun. I don't want it too go.

I am excited about the events that are gonna happen this month though! I have my first quarter of pro-school already started and going great! I am loving my classes and I can only imagine they will get more fun and interesting the deeper I get into the pro-school. Then this weekend I have my niece's birthday! She's a cutie and I get to see KENZI! That might be a large amount of my motivation of going...
Then there is the CRU fall retreat that I am super excited about, I think that should be fun. Then I am getting a 3D printer! that will be an exciting way to spend my time! I hope it works well. Then Kenzi's family is having a harvest party and that will be super fun! I hope that I am not too busy with school to go to it. I will definitely make time though. 

I will be making post probably about my 3D printer as well as my classes. I am currently enrolled in 4 classes:

<ol><li>CS 361: Software Design</li><li>CS 344: Operating Systems</li><li>CS 231: Theoretical Computer Science</li><li>MUS 108: Native American Flute</li></ol>

Which doesn't belong?! I am super excited about all of my classes I think they will be incredibly interesting. Software engineering is a writing intensive course which is disappointing, but it is already starting to cover a lot of important topic such as developrment processes and stuff like that. Operating systems is appearantly going to be doing a lot of shell scripting which I didn't know was a thing until this class. I tried to do it once but with a make page then having the commands in the make procedures. It didn't work. Then Theoretical computer science is about math and stuff. I guess its making math that acts like a simple computer. It's interesting but hard to explain. Then NATIVE AMERICAN FLUTE! I am so stoked about this one! I have had this flute for like two weeks now and have been wanting to play it for awhile. So I have been messing with it for a while and it is fun, but I don't know what I am doing. I only have the class once a week and this week we just went over the sylabus and the teacher told everyone to get a flute! I am sitting there with my flute ready to play and NO ONE ELSE HASS A FLUTE! I thought you were supposed to show up prepared for class on the first day! Oh well I found some scales in the book and I have been practicing them. But then I looked up and apparently you aren't supposed to play the flute that much at first cause they get oo wet, so hopefully I haven't broken my flute yet. Desides learning how to play the flute I will be learning the "one heart" philosophy. This is a native american way of thinking that everyone is of value that we are all created equally. I think it is going to be a great class that will help me be a more open and perspective person.
