This is crazy!

Web Development
// post
		
	Okay I have completely reorganized my files on my web.engr.oregonstate.edu public_html file. I have also started working on a new home page cause the other one was too big and hard to manage. I am going to try and get all the HTML done first before moving forward and adding javascript and other fancy stuff. I think I should follow the same style as the blog. Just to make the whole site seem more connected and less crazy. Here is the HTML code so far.

// code

this is just to see if the code highlighter is working but it is nice to see. I still need to add the descriptions to all the web projects and I want to make the bio longer. but that is what I have so far. It has no styling right now, but I will do that once I get all the HTML written in. 

// code 
Java

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String [] args) {
        System.out.println("HELLO WORLD");
    }
}

// code end

Did that work?
