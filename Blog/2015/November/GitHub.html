I added all this stuff to repositories on GitHub. Which I am not realizing I should go and delete some of those files. Some have some sensitive information on them. Oh well if someone is going to hack me then I will just take the files off GitHub. It won't be that big of a deal. I do have to add every blog post that I make now. That could get repetitive.  Well here are the repositories if you were curious. 

<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/Thecmar7/chores_app.git"><label>Chores_app</label></a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/Thecmar7/my_blog.git"><label>my_blog</label></a></></li></ul>

I wish I would have added these on to gitHub sooner. Then I could look back at all the work that I had done over these months. I would have liked seeing that. I am super proud of this. I have never made anything this nice for myself. I know that I want employers to see it, but really this was something that I wanted to do and I did it. Before anyone had told me that I should make a blog. It's what I wanted to do, and I did it. I mean it's not perfect and it's not the most beautiful thing that anyone has ever seen, but I am proud of it. I think that it will only get better from here. I am excited to see this blog full of posts and code and thoughts and feelings. 

You know this is why I love computer science. I get to be creative, but in a very "unique" way. I know a lot of people know how to code, but anyone can color, or write a story, or play the flute, but coding is more subtle. It is not supposed to be an art.

I am not trying to be super vain or say that I am super special or anything. I totally respect painters and other artists. I also don't pretend to call myself an artist at all. I am just excited. I feel like I have found what will be my art someday.
