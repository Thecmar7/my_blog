I want to get into the practice of writing good code. Not just code that works and runs well but code that works and runs well but it also easy to read, well modularized and reusable. So I am taking a look at the Chores app that I made for my roommates at the end of October. I made that in about a night all on one page using PHP. PHP is such an easy language to be lazy with. I feel like using global variables is ok in PHP, and that writing functions is optional and that really PHP is ugly anyway so it just has to work. But as I look back at the PHP code I wrote for this blog I realize all code no matter what language needs to be written with the intent that it will be read again. So I am redoing the Chores application and adding some functions and making comments and breaking it down into some functions. I am also trying to add a rotate_chores() function so that every week the chores will change to a different person. 

So After refactoring the code I got this much nicer mess of PHP.

// code end

I think this code is much better than the previous code. I haven't actually checked if it works... I will do that later. I am tired right now. Refactoring code is hard work but I am really glad with the result. 

My goal is to have a large PHP library that I can just include with a bunch of well commented and easy to read code. I know that having embedded PHP is kind of a big no no. I am gonna be working on that. I am excited about it a lot. I also want to start creating a C library that I can use on a lot of different projects. I am excited about that too. I know it will be a lot of work but I think it will be worth it and have a reliable and well coded library that I know and can import it to projects and have code that I won't have to rewrite code for every project.
