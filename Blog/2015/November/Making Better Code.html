Making Better Code

I have had so much fun working on my blog today! I was dreading working on making my PHP code cleaner. I thought it would be a lot of hard work, and it would go really slowly, but then I started working on it and it was awesome. Not only was I able to make the code a lot nicer and work a lot better, but I was able to add a couple features I was planning on adding to the Blog. I added the topic links, the sidebar links are now ordered, and the posts that show up are just the first 10 posts rather than the ones that are in the current month. It was so fun. It makes me sad that PHP is kind of a dying language because I am really enjoying it. I guess I am still practicing good coding practices. I think this has been huge for me. 

I knew that comments and functions are important but I always thought that they were more for the grader than anyone else, but as I am creating my own applications I see the importance of how they are useful and just fantastic. It is silly that I have been practicing computer science for 3 years now and have just realized this again. This just makes me realize even more so that I have a lot to learn. I am excited to learn it. 

I will post the code when I get more of the functions done. I got about 4 done today, but I still haven't commented them out yet. I will try to get those up tomorrow. I think I will put this all on my GitHub as well. I think that is a must.
