<h3>Coupling</h3>
<ul>
<ol>
Loose: You and the guy at the convenience store. You communicate through a well-defined protocol to achieve your respective goals - you pay money, he lets you walk out with the bag of Cheetos. Either one of you can be replaced without disrupting the system.
</ol>
<ol>
Tight: You and your wife.
</ol>
</ul>

<h3>Cohesion</h3>
<ul>
<ol>
Low: The convenience store. You go there for everything from gas to milk to ATM banking. Products and services have little in common, and the convenience of having them all in one place may not be enough to offset the resulting increase in cost and decrease in quality.
</ol>
<ol>
High: The cheese store. They sell cheese. Nothing else. Can't beat 'em when it comes to cheese though.
</ol>
</ul>

Thank you <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39946/coupling-and-cohesion/39953">Shog9</a> for that lovely explanation of this computer science concept. I have trouble remembering the the difference between the two. Coupling is when two objects are related, and how tightly they communicate or depend on each other. While cohesion is the specificity that the object has. That is what I get from the example that Shog9 gave us. 

I feel like it is not hard to understand these concepts but it is hard to put them into practice. I feel like the code that usually work with has terrible high cohesion and a lot of coupling. This makes my code very non reusable. all my code is very dependent and specific to the code that it is a part of. I am not sure how to make code that isn't this way. I feel like it would just be breaking up the code even more into much less specific but more flexible code.
