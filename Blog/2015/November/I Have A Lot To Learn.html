I Have A Lot To Learn

I had a great day yesterday. Cru had this quarters Men's breakfast. It was super cool. We had a speaker come and talk to us very personally in our house with twenty guys all piled around on our smelly old couches. The speaker was named Bobby. Bobby is this pretty incredible guy. He shared his story with us about how when he was nineteen he decided that school was not for him. He ended up leaving his community college and moving back to his parents house and living in the garage and just started to study the bible all day. He said he was searching for his purpose that God had for him. He said in that year he was asking himself four questions, and he proposed that these questions are something that we should meditate on and try to answer for ourselves. 

<h3> 1) Who are you? </h3>

Who are you? That doesn't mean what do you do or what is your favorite food. It's more than that. How do you answer that question? 

<h3> 2) What brings you joy? </h3>

Whenever you meet someone you don't ask them "Who are you?", you ask them "What do you do?" What is it that you want to do? What is the that craft that you can do enjoy and become an expert of? For me I feel like it is computer science, programming is what I like to do.

<h3> 3) What do you hate? </h3>

I thought this one was hard. This one is hard for me cause how do I distinguish between what I hate because of my sin or what I hate because God hates the sin that it is. I know that I am passionate about all the normal things that most people should hate. I hate child abuse. I hate abuse in general. I hate that corporations can take advantage of all their faithful workers and consumers. I hate most things that are unfair.

<h3> 4) What are you doing about it? </h3>

I am one of those people that isn't doing a whole lot. Right now I don't feel that I can. I have no power, but that's not true. I just have no motivation. How do I do anything? How do I fight these crazy huge injustices? I don't know. I have always been content just not being part of the problem. I think that is all good, but in the end I have no affect on anyone trapped by these injustices. I am only helping myself feeling better that I am not committing the injustice. I don't know. 

Honestly I don't know how to answer all these questions, but I don't think I am supposed to know how to answer them yet. I am still figuring it out. The thing is that these questions should be bothering me everyday. I should be wrestling with them as I go to sleep and as soon as I wake up I should be searching for their answers.
