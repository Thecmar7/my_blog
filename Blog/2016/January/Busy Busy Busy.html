My goodness my life got a little busier lately. Let's see what has happened? Well Christmas happened and turns out my brother in law Christian had me. He rocked it. He got me the <a href="http://www.teavana.com/us/en/teaware/teaware-new-arrivals/black-teavana-16-oz-perfectea-maker-011034893.html?navid=search&start=5">perfect tea maker</a> and <a href="https://xkcd.com/thing-explainer/">The Thing Explainer</a> and an awesome mouse pad with a picture of me and my old cat. I had to stop looking at it cause I was all teary eyed. I am such a softy when it comes to Kissy or all cats. So yeah Christmas was a great time to see my family and friends and I got to see Kenzi of course. She is awesome and I love her. It's hard being apart though. I kinda realized that the reason it is so hard to be apart is because it is so awesome to be together. This quarter we decided to write each other letters every week. It should be a lot of fun. We have already wrote two letters to each other. Kenzi was really artsy with her first on and made an envelope out of a map and put a heart around Bellingham. I liked it. I felt bad cause I did not put as much effort into it as her, but I think my first letter got lost in the mail so she will never even see it. I hope my second letter makes it. 

In other news it is a new Year so hopefully my blogs file system can handle the new year properly. I guess this post will be the test. But with the new year comes resolutions. I am trying to be more active and lose some weight. I am 203 at the moment so I want to be down to 190 by the end of the quarter. I know that is a long shot but "you can't hit a home run if you don't swing." But along with that I am trying to go running more. So far I have gone running or do some exercise everyday but once this new quarter, and I took that day off on purpose. I am feeling really good about my running and I hope to keep it up all year.

With the new quarter I have new classes. I am taking all computer science classes this quarter and it is going to be crazy! I'm taking analysis of algorithms, networks, usability engineering, and software engineering II. They are all ok. None of my classes are crazy exciting. Analysis of algorithms is gonna be crazy hard, but I think I will be able to handle it. 

As for the Swift series I have been working on it. I am excited to get back into it. I will hopefully do that this weekend.
