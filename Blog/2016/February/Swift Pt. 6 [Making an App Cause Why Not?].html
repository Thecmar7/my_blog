So I have not posted in awhile cause school and social things are getting in the way, but that does not mean that I am not working on stuff I am currently working through a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015214-CH2-SW1">tutorial</a> on making a simple app on using swift. So hopefully I will have some posts about that and how I got that all up and running. But for now I have networking homework to work on and a date to plan for this weekend. I will hopefully have a post up by the end of next week I cannot see myself getting it done this week.
