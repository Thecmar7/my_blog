# my_blog
A PHP file management system that turns text files into nice blogs

This is the blog that I have been working on for a couple month on and off. I am very proud of it. 
I guess for legal reasons I should say please don't just steal my code. I won't mind if you ask, but I did work hard on it.

Thanks for looking at my code. Remember this is alway going to be a work in progress. I will try to make a commit at least once a week.
